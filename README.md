# Description
In this game we will be comparing who has more instagram followers. The game will continue till the answer is right, once the answer is wrong game will be over. So, that means our aim will be to play as long as we can for the high score.

The data for this game is saved in a list of dictionaries in python file named as game_data.py while the logo is an ASCII art saved in a file named as art.py. Modules used in this game are replit to clear the screen and random.

# How to Run
Once the code runs it will generate 'A' and 'B' to compare. A and B will have name of the celebrity , occupation and country to which they belong. Player has to guess which of these two have more followers.

Incase player answers correctly the game will continue with the increase in player's score and then 'B' will be designated as 'A' and a new option will be generated for 'B'. Again the player will guess which of them will have more followers and the game will continue.

But if player guesses incorrectly the game will stop and final score will be shown.
